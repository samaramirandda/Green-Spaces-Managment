| **Relative Frequency Tables**                | A statistical table that displays the proportion of observations falling into various categories or intervals within a dataset. It is constructed by diving the frequency of each category by the total number of observations, expressing the result as a fraction or percentage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Essentially, it is a graph that is derived from another graph by removing some vertices and/or edges. A subgraph retains the same structure as the original graph but may contain fewer vertices and edges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
